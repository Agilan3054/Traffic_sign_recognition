# Traffic Sign Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for a traffic sign recognition project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately classify traffic signs from images. The project strives to create a solution that has practical applications in real-world scenarios. An accurate traffic sign recognition system can be integrated into autonomous vehicles, enhancing their ability to understand and respond to road signs.

## Project Overview

Traffic sign recognition is an important task in autonomous driving and road safety. This project focuses on training a deep learning model to identify and classify traffic signs from images. The code includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and testing on new images.
